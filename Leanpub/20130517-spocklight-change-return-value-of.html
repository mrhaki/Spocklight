<h3 class="post-title">Change Return Value of Mocked or Stubbed Service Based On Argument Value</h3>

<div class="post">
<p>My colleague <a href="http://blog.jdriven.com/author/albert/">Albert van Veen</a> wrote a blog post about <a href="http://blog.jdriven.com/2013/04/using-argumentmatchers-with-mockito/">Using ArgumentMatchers with Mockito</a>. The idea is to let a mocked or stubbed service return a different value based on the argument passed into the service. This is inspired me to write the same sample with <a href="http://code.google.com/p/spock/">Spock</a>.</p><p>Spock already has built-in mock and stub support, so first of all we don&#8217;t need an extra library to support mocking and stubbing. We can easily create a mock or stub with the <code>Mock()</code> and <code>Stub()</code> methods. We will see usage of both in the following examples.</p><p>In the first example we simply return true or false for <code>ChocolateService.doesCustomerLikesChocolate()</code> in the separate test methods.</p><pre class="brush:groovy">import spock.lang.*

public class CandyServiceSpecification extends Specification {

    private ChocolateService chocolateService = Mock()
    private CandyService candyService = new CandyServiceImpl()
 
    def setup() {
        candyService.chocolateService = chocolateService
    }

    def "Customer Albert really likes chocolate"() {
        given:
        final Customer customer = new Customer(firstName: 'Albert')

        and: 'Mock returns true'
        1 * chocolateService.doesCustomerLikesChocolate(customer) &gt;&gt; true
        
        expect: 'Albert likes chocolate'
        candyService.getCandiesLikeByCustomer(customer).contains Candy.CHOCOLATE
    }

    def "Other customer do not like chocolate"() {
        given:
        final Customer customer = new Customer(firstName: 'Any other firstname')

        and: 'Mock returns false'
        1 * chocolateService.doesCustomerLikesChocolate(customer) &gt;&gt; false
        
        expect: 'Customer does not like chocolate'
        !candyService.getCandiesLikeByCustomer(customer).contains(Candy.CHOCOLATE)
    }

}
</pre><p>In the following example we mimic the ArgumentMatcher and this time we use a stub instead of mock.</p><pre class="brush:groovy">import spock.lang.*

public class CandyServiceSpecification extends Specification {

    private CandyService candyService = new CandyServiceImpl()
 
    def setup() {
        candyService.chocolateService = Stub(ChocolateService) {
            getCandiesLikeByCustomer(_) &gt;&gt; { Customer customer -&gt;
                customer?.firstName == 'Albert'
            }
        }
    }

    def "Customer Albert really likes chocolate"() {
        given:
        final Customer customer = new Customer(firstName: 'Albert')
        
        expect: 'Albert likes chocolate'
        candyService.getCandiesLikeByCustomer(customer).contains Candy.CHOCOLATE
    }

    def "Other customer do not like chocolate"() {
        given:
        final Customer customer = new Customer(firstName: 'Any other firstname')
        
        expect: 'Customer does not like chocolate'
        !candyService.getCandiesLikeByCustomer(customer).contains(Candy.CHOCOLATE)
    }

}
